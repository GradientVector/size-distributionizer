# Size Distributionizer

The Size Distributionizer program allows for drawing and measuring lines on uploaded images. The measurement is based on a separately drawn "scale" line.

This program was created by [John Harvey](https://github.com/GradientVector) and [Natalia da Silva Moura](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalia_Da_Silva_Moura) to assist with measuring nano-particles produced at the [Dorman Lab](https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/dormangroup/) at Louisiana State University.
